# Clocking and Timers #

Microcontrollers are often used in situations where timing matters. 
@@
One often has to complete work within precise dealines, and perform
operations where being over a millisecond off is grounds for failure.

Systems are said to be _Real-Time_ if the correctness of an operation
depends on both its logical correctness, and whether the operation is
performed within whatever timing constraints are set.
