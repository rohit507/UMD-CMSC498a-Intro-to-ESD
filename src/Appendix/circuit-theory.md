## Circuit Theory ##

### Voltage and Current ###

There are two major elements we consider when analysing or
designing a circuit, the voltage between any two points on 
a circuit, and the current flowing along a path in the circuit.

Consider a simple circuit with a battery and a resistor, when the 
switch is closed a current will flow along a path. If we imagine
the circuit as
